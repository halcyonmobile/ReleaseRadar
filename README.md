# ReleaseRadar ðŸ“¬

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/halcyonmobile/ReleaseRadar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/halcyonmobile/ReleaseRadar)

Lightweight framework to check release notes after an iOS app update is performed.

## About

With iOS 7, *automatic app updates* were introduced making App Store release notes less relevant for the end user.

Other frameworks like [Siren](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren) check for available updates, **ReleaseRadar** checks for release notes after an update was performed.
